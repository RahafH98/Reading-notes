# **Reading notes**

## Engineering readings 
1. problem solving method >> since everyone of us has a problem solving method to follow mainly coming from experience so there's a unique fingerprint in solving a problem by following a specific path.

2. unique coding kills >> writing a code can be different from one developer to  another so there's a strength in having a unique way of writing code.

3. communication the ability to work with a team and make the non- developers understand a code through great communication skills in an underestimated value needed in developers. 

for me whenever I face a problem I will firstly take a break to clear my mind and make it reboot to start again fresh, I will look for help from a trusted source like an instructor or teammate and so and finally I will break the problem down and solve it piece by piece.

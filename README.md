| SQL        | SQL has many commands that control databases and perform various operations, such as adding and dropping columns. It also includes keywords like `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` for data filtering and manipulation. SQL is essential for efficient database management. |
| Terminal   | The terminal part involves the usage of various commands to perform operations on files and directories. It is a command-line interface through which users can interact with the computer's operating system and execute tasks like adding, modifying, or deleting files and directories. In the context of coding, the terminal is often used to compile and run programs, manage version control systems, and perform other development-related tasks. |

| Mind Growth| Mind Growth refers to the process of developing a growth mindset, which helps in controlling ideas, developing skills, and improving various aspects of life, including time management, problem-solving, and communication skills. This growth mindset is essential for focusing on continuous improvement in coding and striving to become a better developer. |

| DSA        | The selection of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) algorithm should consider its time complexity, ensuring the problem is solved with minimum time and operations. For example, **arrays** are fast for accessing elements using indices but slow for adding or deleting elements. **Linked lists (LL)** are fast at insertion and deletion but slower at extracting an element by index. Considering the complexity of operations aids in choosing the most suitable algorithm for a given problem. To avoid infinite recursion, a **Base Case** is necessary, stopping the recursion and ensuring the problem progresses towards the base case in each recursive call. |

| Reading Enginnering     | addressing this topic is all what our major is evolving around evantually we are studying to solve problems via tachs and to develop applications and website that makes he world a lot easier for others so this topic strongly relates to our studying meatriels to know how to develop the problem solving skill and how to improve other related skills and give a hint about how to act when there's a problem a head of you  |
